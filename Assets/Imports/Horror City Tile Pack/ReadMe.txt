Hi there! You're an awesome person and I appreciate you buying this thing wot I did :)

This pack is a collection of tiles created for my POP! style of RPG Horror graphics. Featuring multiple interior and exterior modern locations, with assets including 56 different wall types, interior and exterior flooring, animated water, crashed vehicles, blood stains, street signs, dumpsters, apartment objects, railings, stairs, industrial equipment, office objects, accents, lights, accessories and much, much more, this bumper tile pack is perfect for bringing a cutely gritty, grungey look to your horror/zombie games. Arranged in both original sized 16x16 and "plug and play" 32x32 RPG Maker VX Ace formatting for ease of use.

Also included are some fully animated doors and a selection of 16 NPC character sprites to really get you on your way to making your game! The majority of this content has been made previously available under an RPG Maker Only license via RPGMaker.web and via RPG Maker dlc on Steam - however, this version allows this content for the first time, to be used in any game creation engine you like!

Other POP! and Horror City graphics will be made available on itch soon for use in all engines, but if you're an RPG Maker user, all currently released POP! graphic packs are available on Steam - search for POP! Horror City or check out the DLC sections for RPG Maker VX Ace and RPG Maker MV!
